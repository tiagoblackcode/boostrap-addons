boostrap-addons
===============

is a wip set of bootstrap add-ons to extend its functionality. Currently is in its early stage but plans are to keep improving the existing plugins and create new ones.

Available plugins
-----------------

These are the plugins available:
* **radio-group.js** enables the radio and pseudo-radio input selection using bootstrap markup and hiding the usual form controls
* **confirm-popover-js** enables you to define actions that are only performed upon confirmation. It presents a dialog in the form of a popover so that the user confirms the action he's about to take

You can checkout the project and watch them in action.
